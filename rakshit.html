          <h2>Why Trees Matter</h2>
          <p>Trees are vital to our planet. They provide oxygen, improve air quality
            , conserve water, and support wildlife. Without trees,
             life on Earth would not be possible
             Trees are often called the lungs of our planet, and for good reason. Beyond producing oxygen, their importance lies in their remarkable ability to combat climate change and support ecosystems
             . Trees play a vital role in the environment by improving air quality, reducing pollution, and providing
              essential habitats for wildlife. Their benefits are vast, making trees indispensable for maintaining 
              ecological balance and sustaining life on Earth.Forests are of immense importance in soil stabilization and erosion control, especially in mountainous and hilly regions; they also protect and conserve water supplies and prevent floods. Small groups of trees and even single trees have a similar role locally in preventing washouts and in holding stream banks. As mentioned above, trees contribute significantly to nutrient recycling, carbon dioxide absorption, and oxygen generation.
    
              Economic importance
              Of all the products that come from trees, those that are wood-based are by far of the greatest importance (see wood). Carbonized and fossilized wood (coal) supplies fuel for energy needs; other fossilized products of trees include amber, which is formed from the gum of pines, and kauri gum. From earliest times wood has been employed for such items as homes, rafts, canoes, fuel, and weapons.
              
              Primitive peoples were dependent on trees for many materials in addition to wood. Fruits and nuts of many kinds were important foods for both humans and animals. Leaves of palms and other trees were used for thatching roofs. Cloth and woven fabrics made from bark, leaves, and other tree parts were used for clothing. Utensils were fashioned from calabashes, coconuts, and other fruits. Medicines, including quinine, were obtained from trees, as were dyes, tanning materials, and spices.
              
              Modern civilizations are no less dependent on trees. Although substitutes now are commonly used for some tree products, the demand for trees remains strong, as in the manufacture of newsprint and other papers, as well as cardboard and similar packagings. The plywood industry converts immense numbers of trees into building materials..</p>
